# C-Programs

This repository contains a collection of C programs that I created while learning C programming during my first semester. These programs cover a variety of topics, helping me understand the basics of programming and problem-solving.

## Contents

Here is the list of programs included in this repository:

1. **Armstrong2.c** - Checks if a number is an Armstrong number.

3. **Fibonacci.c** - Generates a Fibonacci series up to a certain number.
4. **Fibonacci_function.c** - Generates a Fibonacci series using a function.
5. **Fibonacci_nth.c** - Calculates the nth Fibonacci number.
6. **FtoC.c** - Converts temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
7. **HCF.c** - Calculates the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of two numbers.
8. **LCM.c** - Calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers.
9. **Palindrome_recursion.c** - Checks if a string or number is a palindrome using recursion.
10. **Prime_check.c** - Checks if a number is prime.
11. **Prime_using_new_logic.c** - Implements a different logic for checking prime numbers.
12. **Reverse_of_dig_recur.c** - Reverses the digits of a number using recursion.
13. **Sum_Series.c** - Computes the sum of a series of numbers.
14. **Sum_n_Even.c** - Calculates the sum of the first n even numbers.
15. **Sum_natural_function.c** - Calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using a function.
16. **Sum_of_digits_recursion.c** - Computes the sum of digits of a number using recursion.
17. **Sum_of_even_function.c** - Finds the sum of even numbers using a function.
18. **Sum_of_even_numbers.c** - Calculates the sum of all even numbers up to a given limit.
19. **Sumofdigits.c** - Computes the sum of digits of a number.
20. **fact.c** - Calculates the factorial of a number.
21. **lcm2.c** - Another program to calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM).
22. **prime_series.c** - Generates a series of prime numbers.
23. **prime_series_with_limits.c** - Generates prime numbers within specified limits.
24. **prime_without_flag.c** - Checks if a number is prime without using a flag.
25. **reverse_of_digit.c** - Reverses the digits of a number.
26. **sum_of_digits.c** - Computes the sum of digits of a number.
27. **sum_of_digits_function.c** - Computes the sum of digits using a function.
28. **sum_of_even_digits.c** - Calculates the sum of even digits in a number.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document my progress and learning as I explore C programming concepts. These programs cover basic concepts such as loops, recursion, functions, and number manipulation.
